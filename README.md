Congratulations! You have just passed our first round of interview and you are interested in our project. This is awesome!
Yet this is just the beginning üòâ We care a lot about our people and we do our best to make sure everyone joining the team is raising the bar.  
During your interviews rounds at Protagonist we evaluate your personal values, technical skills, team spirit, etc. Our goal is to hire people that are better than us! Yes you read this correctly! 
We want to make sure that every new hire is better than the rest of the team. Because this is the only way we as team can keep improving and learning from each other. Everyone in our team wants to keep building great stuff he can be proud of! Are you one of us? üôÇ  

The goal of the test below is to evaluate your super pow...oups, sorry I mean your coding skills. Please show us how awesome you are.

Your coding test assignment and goals are:
1. Click this link -> https://projects.invisionapp.com/d/main#/projects/prototypes/12669051
2. Review the app - you should be able to access ‚Äúinspect mode‚Äù to see all the sizes and colors
3. Implement this design using any technologies you like (SASS/LESS/SCSS are prefered over simple CSS yet not obligatory). So  you have complete freedom here.
   * All assets are downloadable in inspect mode
   * Feel free to use ipsum lorem / random image generators. 
   * Masonry grid is a big plus, but not required
4. Upload your source codes to GitHub
5. And Send the link to us - nikolai.b@protagonist.gg

Should you have any question or ideas how we can improve this assignment - fell free to create an [issue](https://github.com/Yunoia/ui-coder-assignment/issues/new)

Good Luck!

Yuno√Øa team.
